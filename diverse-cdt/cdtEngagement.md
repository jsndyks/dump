#### **CDT Collaboration**

This is an internal document that describes possible items on our **Offer Menu** ... for thinking purposes!

It needs developing into a menu of options for potential collaborators, or perhaps a series of menus for :

 * potential industrial partners
 * potential government, NGO & charity partners
 * potential supervisors - they need to know what to expect

JD has drafted this based upon :
 * Raj's **CDT engagement plan V1.0**
 * [GeoSpatialCDT Engagement Opportunities](https://geospatialcdt.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/V1-Engagement-Table.png)
  * discussions with Steph

##### Defining the Centre for Doctoral Training ...

_Help us co-create the DIVERSE CDT for Data Visualization._
_We need active partners to identify needs for skills, competencies and research, and to frame these in ways that will generate the people that we need to make use of data and make data useful._

| _Activity:_ **Design Study** - a longer term effort in which groups of research students apply _Design Study Methodology_ to explore data challenges and opportunities and develop solutions (software prototypes, analytical workflows, preliminary reports) to known challenges for which visual data science can offer insights and progress. | Time to work with the academic team and students to prepare data, discuss needs, engage in creative thinking exercises, provide iterative feedback on progress and evaluate solutions as they develop. Weekly or fortnightly 'check-ins' of max 30 mins over a 3-month period. Attend showcase event at which solutions are presented, and results handover occurs. | none                   | Students retain IP |

_Work with the University Research & Enterprise Office to develop NDAs and for guidance on IP._

> _Raj mentions: inspiring researchers on "social responsibility" (his quotes). I am not completely convinced by this angle.
This would be more persuasive if we were taking data from NGOs for free - so we could do something with this. Perhaps one hackathon should be a social good hackathon? But that should not really be part of this menu should it?

> _GeoSpatialCDT: use the phrase "1-month consultancy piece"_

> _GeoSpatialCDT: has a "Short project co-supervision option" to 
"Test out collaboration". I would drop this as we have the Design Study and plans for MSc Project._

_NOTE: Fees are at 2023 levels, subject to change, and likely to vary in line with inflation._

> _Raj mentions: external PhD supervision as involving "giving advice, organise access to the business experts, arrange data for the research, provide access to the laboratories and computing facilities (e.g. GPU compute) and conduct proactive monitoring of the research and its impact."

> _GeoSpatialCDT: project is "of your choosing", and "bespoke" "a significant contribution is required, including staff time, training, data-sharing, use of equipment and facilities". They tal about supervision "in partnership with our academics" and that full funding is required to "secure arising IP"._

> _GeoSpatialCDT: £13.5k per year, over 4 years part-funding, £27k per year, over 4 years fully funded._

### QUESTIONS & NOTES

_QUESTION: Do we provide stipend for Prof PhD?_

_QUESTION: Do PT students have to cost half the total of FT students? Ours take 5/4 of the time but we need total fees to be equivalent?_

_QUESTION: What pattern works for a PT student who is caring? <br/> This is a good scenario tho think about on the diversity theme._

_QUESTION: What do we do about partners from government, NGO, charities and community grous? How do we vary the funding model?

_IDEA: Don't pitch part-time to potential funders. Say in proposal that we will encourage PT applicants and offer flexibility in terms of their programme of learning depending upon their circumstances?<br/> This is inclusive._
