I work in Data Visualization, Information Visualization and often with Geographic Information.

Most of my research involves making (designing, implementing) something and seeing whether (when, how well) it works.

The things are usually software prototypes that involve novel graphical representations of data to help people perform challenging tasks. But they might be interactions or algorithms or physical objects.

The testing usually involves assessing people in controlled conditions (experiments) or in using systems in the workplace (fieldwork).
