## Vignette Responses

Here are the literals from the three questions in which we asked people for written responses.

I would like you each to read through and select **ONE** statement that resonates with you, in terms of your hopes and efforts as a seminar organiser.

This may be a positive resonance, or a negative one - something that makes you happy, or uneasy.

Something that shows success or something that raises a concern.

But please pick something, and explain why - with some kind of reaction - if you would.

### What would encourage you to Give a Talk

Quite happy to share interesting ideas related to the research I do.

Time is the key barrier - in one respect, preparation is minimal as the talks are short. In another, focusing and planning to keep to time takes time. Encouraged by peers within research centres championing and promoting.

Not much. I think we need more specialized seminars.

A lighter workload. Fewer overlaps. Not having given various ones already (particularly about the same topic). We need fewer events of higher quality. This seminar series is a good model- if only we had fewer commitments elsewhere.

Lack of confidence. Nothing you can do to help.

I'm motivated, a lack of time is my main problem, but I had several. I think this is a great activity!

If I have time, I am happy to give a talk.

Currently don't have much to say.

I'm not good at quick fire talks. Maybe we could experiment with 2 short, 1 long, or some other configuration?

In person would be definitely better.

A more informal setting and a slightly longer time slot - 3 mins is over in a flash. Maybe 8-10 mins would help.

"I have given a talk.

Barrier: too busy to think about it."

The remote/hybrid thing is a downer for me, I can do this with people I know well and trust but the whole webcam off, background, silence, muted,things is awful. It also forces you into powerpoint/slide territory which I find quite limiting.

Not having anything to talk about - otherwise none.

barriers: lack of time

The timing doesn't work for me, as it's just at school pick up time. A 2-3pm timeslot would encourage me both to give a talk, and also attend talks.

I need content to talk about and time to prepare my slides.

Giving a talk is fine, but I am not sure if anything interesting has come out of them, any new collaborations? Any 1-to-1 talks after? What about a session where we say what came out of the vignettes

Already done one.

If we stick with 3 minutes, would rather see it more normal just to use that time to posit an idea for discussion, not a summary of an entire PhD project, or summary of last few years of research. We seem to have normalised squeezing large topics into a small space so makes it harder to give a talk based on a smaller idea to promote discussion.

### What would encourage you to Attend & Participate In Discussion

Vignettes that make non-trivial, intellectually stimulating work accessible.

Accessible subject matter (sometimes I struggle to understand the more technical talks)

Talks in my research area.

There's a feeling that people will be judged negatively. Or that we don't know enough. The department's interests are so diverse that it's hard to ask good questions that are not too generic when it's not your area of expertise. However I don't feel like I need extra encouragement (and others may be grateful for that).

People are passive-aggressive about other people's comments.

I do engage when I attend. I feel that this is an open space for people to interact.

If I a have ideas or comments that I think might be valuable to the speaker/audience

n/a

Having the sessions in person.

In person would be definitely better.

One way to consider doing this could be having 2 talks (each 10 mins for presenting + 10 mins for questions). The first 5 - 10 mins could be just introducing any new folks joining the department - researchers, faculty, research students. Or any news and updates on the research front that anybody would like to share. And similarly, the last 5 - 10 mins could be any reminders, suggestions, chit chat.

Would be easier in-person.

This is not only for vignettes but some kind of moderation would be nice, to help tease me out of my shell. And possibly friendly reminders to those who are not shy, and do not mind taking up space, that there's no harm in sitting one out once in a while. I might need ten or fifteen seconds of silence to get my courage up. (Count it out, it feels like two minutes.)

I try and engage as best I can. Embarrassment of making myself look ignorant may put me off from asking questions.

barriers:

- on some topics we need a ""primer on my specialty - what it means and what it might mean for you"" talk which would need to be 10 to 30 minutes (and the time for most of us to attend it)... no point in asking questions that would require 15 minuts to answer
- sometimes a question only makes sense for those who know that much (the possible contents of that primer) about MY specialty... or anyway, a well-articulated question will not fit into the time slot"

More women!

In-person presentations would be nice.

Barrier: not understanding enough about the topic.

If I post a Q in the chat, I don't necessarily want to read it out again on mic. Perhaps the chair can read the question if it has already been posted to chat. For those who would rather ask directly, they can raise a hand.

Everyone is smarter than me. Nothing you can do about that. :-)

### Open Comments

I think it should serve to know about the work of people from City, so mainly people in the Department and eventually maybe some speakers from other schools or departments, maybe once per term, or as an hybrid session with less 10 mins talks and some 20mins talk from external speakers from other depts of City.

Periodically get feedback (e.g. in the form of online questionnaires, or polls during a vignette) from colleagues to find out what works and what doesn't. Analyse the feedback and present some findings in a vignette, to stimulate engagement and improve the seminars.

I think they're a testament to your strong organisation and marketing! They're great, and attendance is consistently high. They work far better than previous seminars. Maybe allow/encourage people to stick around for 10 mins afterwards to follow up on ideas with any of the speakers?

I donâ€™t think that these research series make much sense. They are too general and the audience is too heterogeneous.

This is a hard one. I think that as it is it's working very well. An issue is the risk of hearing from the same voices frequently. Good research takes time; we can't always have something new (and good) to talk about. PhDs should be encouraged to present but perhaps not necessarily along more senior academics- this can be quite intimidating and a barrier for more PhDs to volunteer. Also see the first comment- a PhD will be working on topic, it will be a while before they feel they can talk about it to others and once they have done that that's it. We are a big group but we are really not that big. How often do we expect the same colleagues to talk about new work? These are just questions out loud, no answers, sorry. In brief, what we need is a rethink of how the department and the school operates in terms of workload and expectations.

I enjoy them greatly and I like the format. I think they work very well.

I haven't seen any CS research seminars announced for at least a year (only seminars by centres). If there were any, you need to publicise (I just searched my e-mails for 'computer science seminar' with no luck).

It is very nice and should continue. Maybe 5 minutes is too short and we could extend to more, while doing it more regularly?

Like the vignettes. Perhaps some 20-30 min seminars/discussions/get together might be interesting.

Love them and really grateful to the people organising them - I know how hard it is. As said, maybe there's the chance to be even more experimental with format?

"It's good, talking about who's doing what is useful.

Maybe the time is too short, I think people could talk at least twice longer, that way things can be explained better, and you need less people per seminar."

Oops, sorry wrote the answer for this on the previous question and page. The research seminar could be a space for learning about each other's research but ALSO, to just become familiar with each other (through intros, updates, news). For instance, while wrapping up, we could share a list of events coming up, it could interesting talks or grants or student thesis presentations, etc.

"Some speakers try to say far too much. They rush. They have too many slides.

Others don't make their research accessible to a general CS audience.
Otherwise good."

"Computer Science Research Seminar" - is this the vignettes or some other thing? If it's the vignettes I absolutely love the format and the idea of it, if it's something else I do not know. (Though personal circumstances and time of day has prevented me from joining most of them, and also the remote format.)

I think its a very good idea - its nice to have a short space in the timetable where we can engage with other colleagues work and see what they are doing.

Seminars need to position themselves somewhere between the ""too specialistic for most of us"" and ""too simplistic for most of us"" ends.. i think that the ""accessible to most of us"" kind is the more necessary type -- CS and its application are too vast a topic and we all need an educated layperson's knowledge of what is current outside our on specialty. Important to label the seminars and inform the speakers consistently ""we'll advertise this as suitable for all CS people, or 'all SST people'..or should we tell them that it is for these with expertise in X?""

NB I think this has been often done quite right. It's just that getting it wrong occasionally may have larger consequences than it should have.

it's also hard for speakers to fashion a very accessible talk that won't sound trite/patronising to fellow specialists"

I've enjoyed the seminars I've managed to attend. It would be lovely to have it in person, with 10 minutes left free at the end for people to mingle

Sounds like a lot of work but maybe some very quick training on improving your presentations?

It should be emphasised that a 3 minute presentation is not taking a 15 minutes and speaking quicker. It has to be planned to be 3 minutes. Or alternatively, let's have 2 x 15 minutes presentations.

I find online difficult, but appreciate that there would be other challenges with in-person. Would love to see more external speakers.

Please keep speakers to time. I find it stressful hearing a talk that was meant to stop at three minutes continuing on to minute 4...5...10 (as we had today). This would also help in expectation management - these are not conference presentations, but structured prompts for discussion.

I like the format and especially that it is short. It is good, can't think of improvements. Usually a couple of people dominate discussion but they always have interesting points so how can one object to that?
